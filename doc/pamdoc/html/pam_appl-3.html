<H2><A NAME="s3">3. The public interface to <B>Linux-PAM</B></A></H2>

<P>Firstly, the relevant include file for the <B>Linux-PAM</B> library
is <CODE>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</CODE>. It contains the definitions
for a number of functions. After listing these functions, we collect
some guiding remarks for programmers.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 What can be expected by the application</A>
</H2>

<P>Below we document those functions in the <B>Linux-PAM</B> library that
may be called from an application.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="pam-start-section"></A> Initialization of Linux-PAM</H3>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This is the first of the <B>Linux-PAM</B> functions that must be
called by an application. It initializes the interface and reads the
system configuration file, <CODE>/etc/pam.conf</CODE> (see the
<B>Linux-PAM</B> System Administrators' Guide).  Following a successful
return (<CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE>) the contents of <CODE>*pamh</CODE> is a handle that
provides continuity for successive calls to the <B>Linux-PAM</B>
library.  The arguments expected by <CODE>pam_start</CODE> are as follows: the
<CODE>service_name</CODE> of the program, the <CODE>user</CODE>name of the individual
to be authenticated, a pointer to an application-supplied
<CODE>pam_conv</CODE> structure and a pointer to a <CODE>pam_handle_t</CODE>
<EM>pointer</EM>.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>pam_conv</CODE> structure is discussed more fully in the section
<A HREF="#the-conversation-function">below</A>.  The
<CODE>pam_handle_t</CODE> is a <EM>blind</EM> structure and the
application should not attempt to probe it directly for information.
Instead the <B>Linux-PAM</B> library provides the functions
<CODE>pam_set_item</CODE> and <CODE>pam_get_item</CODE>.  These functions are
documented below.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
extern int pam_end(pam_handle_t *pamh, int pam_status);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This function is the last function an application should call in the
<B>Linux-PAM</B> library.  Upon return the handle <CODE>pamh</CODE> is no
longer valid and all memory associated with it will be invalid (likely
to cause a segmentation fault if accessed).
<P>
<P>Under normal conditions the argument <CODE>pam_status</CODE> has the value
PAM_SUCCESS, but in the event of an unsuccessful application for
service the appropriate <B>Linux-PAM</B> error-return value should be
used here. Note, <CODE>pam_end()</CODE> unconditionally shuts down the
authentication stack associated with the <CODE>pamh</CODE> handle. The value
taken by <CODE>pam_status</CODE> is used as an argument to the module specific
callback functions, <CODE>cleanup()</CODE> (see the <B>Linux-PAM</B> 
<A HREF="pam_modules.html">Module Developers' Guide</A>). In this way,
the module can be given notification of the pass/fail nature of the
tear-down process, and perform any last minute tasks that are
appropriate to the module before it is unlinked.

extern int pam_fail_delay(pam_handle_t *pamh, unsigned int micro_sec);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This function is offered by <B>Linux-PAM</B> to facilitate time delays
following a failed call to <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> and before control
is returned to the application. When using this function the
application programmer should check if it is available with,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#ifdef PAM_FAIL_DELAY
    ....
#endif /* PAM_FAIL_DELAY */
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>Generally, an application requests that a user is authenticated by
<B>Linux-PAM</B> through a call to <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> or
<CODE>pam_chauthtok()</CODE>.  These functions call each of the <EM>stacked</EM>
authentication modules listed in the relevant <B>Linux-PAM</B>
configuration file.  As directed by this file, one of more of the
modules may fail causing the <CODE>pam_...()</CODE> call to return an error.
It is desirable for there to also be a pause before the application
continues. The principal reason for such a delay is security: a delay
acts to discourage <EM>brute force</EM> dictionary attacks primarily, but
also helps hinder <EM>timed</EM> (covert channel) attacks.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>pam_fail_delay()</CODE> function provides the mechanism by which an
application or module can suggest a minimum delay (of <CODE>micro_sec</CODE>
<EM>micro-seconds</EM>). <B>Linux-PAM</B> keeps a record of the longest time
requested with this function. Should <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> fail,
the failing return to the application is delayed by an amount of time
randomly distributed (by up to 25%) about this longest value.
<P>
<P>Independent of success, the delay time is reset to its zero default
value when <B>Linux-PAM</B> returns control to the application.
<P>
<P>For applications written with a single thread that are event driven in
nature, <CODE>libpam</CODE> generating this delay may be undesirable. Instead,
the application may want to register the delay in some other way. For
example, in a single threaded server that serves multiple
authentication requests from a single event loop, the application
might want to simply mark a given connection as blocked until an
application timer expires. For this reason, <B>Linux-PAM</B> supplies
the <CODE>PAM_FAIL_DELAY</CODE> item. It can be queried and set with
<CODE>pam_get_item()</CODE> and <CODE>pam_set_item()</CODE> respectively. The value
used to set it should be a function pointer of the following
prototype:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
void (*delay_fn)(int retval, unsigned usec_delay, void *appdata_ptr);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The arguments being the <CODE>retval</CODE> return code of the module stack,
the <CODE>usec_delay</CODE> micro-second delay that libpam is requesting and
the <CODE>appdata_ptr</CODE> that the application has associated with the
current <CODE>pamh</CODE> (<CODE>pam_handle_t</CODE>). This last value was set by the
application when it called <CODE>pam_start</CODE> or explicitly with
<CODE>pam_set_item(... , PAM_CONV, ...)</CODE>. Note, if <CODE>PAM_FAIL_DELAY</CODE>
is unset (or set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>), then <CODE>libpam</CODE> will perform any
delay.

<P>
<P>A credential is something that the user possesses.  It is some

<P>The <CODE>libpam</CODE> library associates with each PAM-handle (<CODE>pamh</CODE>), a
set of <I>PAM environment variables</I>. These variables are intended to
hold the session environment variables that the user will inherit when
the session is granted and the authenticated user obtains access to
the requested service. For example, when <CODE>login</CODE> has finally given
the user a shell, the environment (as viewed with the command
<CODE>env</CODE>) will be what <CODE>libpam</CODE> was maintaining as the PAM
environment for that service application. Note, these variables are not
the environment variables of the <CODE>login</CODE> application. This is
principally for two reasons: <CODE>login</CODE> may want to have an
environment that cannot be seen or manipulated by a user; and
<CODE>login</CODE> (or whatever the serving application is) may be maintaining
a number of parallel sessions, via different <CODE>pamh</CODE> values, at the
same time and a single environment may not be appropriately shared
between each of these. The PAM environment may contain variables
seeded by the applicant user's client program, for example, and as
such it is not appropriate for one applicant to interfere with the
environment of another applicant.

<P>The PAM environment variables (see section 
<A HREF="#pam-putenv-section">above</A>) are a complete set of enviroment
variables that are associated with a PAM-handle (<CODE>pamh</CODE>). They
represent the contents of the <I>regular</I> environment variables of
the authenticated user when service is granted.
<P>
<P>Th function, <CODE>pam_getenvlist()</CODE> returns a pointer to a complete,
<CODE>malloc()</CODE>'d, copy of the PAM environment.  It is a pointer to a
duplicated list of environment variables.  It should be noted that
this memory will never be <CODE>free()'d</CODE> by <CODE>libpam</CODE>.  Once obtained
by a call to <CODE>pam_getenvlist()</CODE>, <B>it is the responsibility of
the calling application</B> to <CODE>free()</CODE> this memory.
<P>
<P>The format of the memory is a <CODE>malloc()</CODE>'d array of <CODE>char *</CODE>
pointers, the last element of which is set to <CODE>NULL</CODE>. Each of the
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE> entries in this array point to a <CODE>NUL</CODE> terminated and
<CODE>malloc()</CODE>'d <CODE>char</CODE> string of the form:
<CODE>"</CODE><I>name</I><CODE>=</CODE><I>value</I><CODE>"</CODE>.

<P>It is by design, and not a coincidence, that the format and contents
of the returned array matches that required for the third argument of

<H3><A NAME="the-conversation-function"></A> The conversation function</H3>

<P>An application must provide a ``conversation function''. It is used
for direct communication between a loaded module and the application
and will typically provide a means for the module to prompt the user
for a password etc. . The structure, <CODE>pam_conv</CODE>, is defined by
including <CODE>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</CODE>; to be,
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct pam_conv {
    int (*conv)(int num_msg,
        const struct pam_message **msg,
        struct pam_response **resp,
        void *appdata_ptr);
    void *appdata_ptr;
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>It is initialized by the application before it is passed to the
library.  The <EM>contents</EM> of this structure are attached to the
<CODE>*pamh</CODE> handle.  The point of this argument is to provide a
mechanism for any loaded module to interact directly with the
application program. This is why it is called a <EM>conversation</EM>
structure.
<P>
<P>When a module calls the referenced <CODE>conv()</CODE> function, the argument
<CODE>*appdata_ptr</CODE> is set to the second element of this structure.
<P>
<P>The other arguments of a call to <CODE>conv()</CODE> concern the information
exchanged by module and application. That is to say, <CODE>num_msg</CODE>
holds the length of the array of pointers, <CODE>msg</CODE>. After a
successful return, the pointer <CODE>*resp</CODE> points to an array of
<CODE>pam_response</CODE> structures, holding the application supplied text.
Note, <CODE>*resp</CODE> is an <CODE>struct pam_response</CODE> array and <EM>not</EM> an
array of pointers.
<P>
<P>The message (from the module to the application) passing structure is
defined by <CODE>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</CODE> as:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct pam_message {
    int msg_style;
    const char *msg;
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Valid choices for <CODE>msg_style</CODE> are:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF</CODE></B><DD><P>Obtain a string without echoing any text
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON</CODE></B><DD><P>Obtain a string whilst echoing text
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_ERROR_MSG</CODE></B><DD><P>Display an error
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_TEXT_INFO</CODE></B><DD><P>Display some text.
</DL>
<P>
<P>The point of having an array of messages is that it becomes possible
to pass a number of things to the application in a single call from
the module. It can also be convenient for the application that related
things come at once: a windows based application can then present a
single form with many messages/prompts on at once.
<P>
<P>In passing, it is worth noting that there is a descrepency between the
way Linux-PAM handles the <CODE>const struct pam_message **msg</CODE>
conversation function argument from the way that Solaris' PAM (and
derivitives, known to include HP/UX, <EM>are there others?</EM>)
does. Linux-PAM interprets the <CODE>msg</CODE> argument as entirely
equivalent to the following prototype <CODE>const struct pam_message
*msg[]</CODE> (which, in spirit, is consistent with the commonly used
prototypes for <CODE>argv</CODE> argument to the familiar <CODE>main()</CODE>
function: <CODE>char **argv</CODE>; and <CODE>char *argv[]</CODE>). Said another way
Linux-PAM interprets the <CODE>msg</CODE> argument as a pointer to an array of
<CODE>num_meg</CODE> read only 'struct pam_message' <EM>pointers</EM>.  Solaris'
PAM implementation interprets this argument as a pointer to a pointer
to an array of <CODE>num_meg</CODE> <CODE>pam_message</CODE> structures.  Fortunately,
perhaps, for most module/application developers when <CODE>num_msg</CODE> has
a value of one these two definitions are entirely
equivalent. Unfortunately, casually raising this number to two has led
to unanticipated compatibility problems.
<P>
<P>For what its worth the two known module writer work-arounds for trying
to maintain source level compatibility with both PAM implementations
are:
<UL>
<LI> never call the conversation function with <CODE>num_msg</CODE> greater
than one.</LI>
<LI> set up <CODE>msg</CODE> as doubly referenced so both types of
conversation function can find the messages. That is, make

<P>The response (from the application to the module) passing structure is
defined by including <CODE>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</CODE> as:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
struct pam_response {
    char *resp;
    int resp_retcode;
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Currently, there are no definitions for <CODE>resp_retcode</CODE> values; the
normal value is <CODE>0</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Prior to the 0.59 release of Linux-PAM, the length of the returned
<CODE>pam_response</CODE> array was equal to the number of <EM>prompts</EM> (types
<CODE>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF</CODE> and <CODE>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON</CODE>) in the
<CODE>pam_message</CODE> array with which the conversation function was
called.  This meant that it was not always necessary for the module to
<CODE>free(3)</CODE> the responses if the conversation function was only used
to display some text.
<P>
<P>Post Linux-PAM-0.59.  The number of responses is always equal to the
<CODE>num_msg</CODE> conversation function argument.  This is slightly easier
to program but does require that the response array is <CODE>free(3)</CODE>'d
after every call to the conversation function.  The index of the
responses corresponds directly to the prompt index in the
<CODE>pam_message</CODE> array.
<P>
<P>The maximum length of the <CODE>pam_msg.msg</CODE> and <CODE>pam_response.resp</CODE>
character strings is <CODE>PAM_MAX_MSG_SIZE</CODE>.  (This is not enforced by
Linux-PAM.)
<P>
<P><CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> is the expected return value of this
function.  However, should an error occur the application should not
set <CODE>*resp</CODE> but simply return <CODE>PAM_CONV_ERR</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Note, if an application wishes to use two conversation functions, it
should activate the second with a call to <CODE>pam_set_item()</CODE>.
<P>
<P><B>Notes:</B> New item types are being added to the conversation
protocol.  Currently Linux-PAM supports: <CODE>PAM_BINARY_PROMPT</CODE>
and <CODE>PAM_BINARY_MSG</CODE>.  These two are intended for server-client
hidden information exchange and may be used as an interface for
maching-machine authentication.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Programming notes</A>
</H2>

<P>Note, all of the authentication service function calls accept the
token <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>, which instructs the modules to not send
messages to the application. This token can be logically OR'd with any
one of the permitted tokens specific to the individual function calls.
<CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE> does not override the prompting of the user for
passwords etc., it only stops informative messages from being
generated.
