</H2>

<P>First, we cover what the module should expect from the <B>Linux-PAM</B>
library and a <B>Linux-PAM</B> <EM>aware</EM> application. Essesntially this
is the <CODE>libpam.*</CODE> library.

<H3>Setting data</H3>

<P>Synopsis:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
extern int pam_set_data(pam_handle_t *pamh,
                        const char *module_data_name,
                        void *data,
                        void (*cleanup)(pam_handle_t *pamh,

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The modules may be dynamically loadable objects. In general such files
should not contain <CODE>static</CODE> variables. This and the subsequent
function provide a mechanism for a module to associate some data with
the handle <CODE>pamh</CODE>. Typically a module will call the
<CODE>pam_set_data()</CODE> function to register some data under a (hopefully)
unique <CODE>module_data_name</CODE>. The data is available for use by other
modules too but <EM>not</EM> by an application.
<P>
<P>The function <CODE>cleanup()</CODE> is associated with the <CODE>data</CODE> and, if
non-<CODE>NULL</CODE>, it is called when this data is over-written or
following a call to <CODE>pam_end()</CODE> (see the Linux-PAM Application
Developers' Guide).
<P>
<P>The <CODE>error_status</CODE> argument is used to indicate to the module the
sort of action it is to take in cleaning this data item. As an
example, Kerberos creates a ticket file during the authentication
phase, this file might be associated with a data item. When
<CODE>pam_end()</CODE> is called by the module, the <CODE>error_status</CODE>
carries the return value of the <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> or other
<CODE>libpam</CODE> function as appropriate. Based on this value the Kerberos
module may choose to delete the ticket file (<EM>authentication
failure</EM>) or leave it in place.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>error_status</CODE> may have been logically OR'd with either of the
following two values:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_DATA_REPLACE</CODE></B><DD><P>When a data item is being replaced (through a second call to
<CODE>pam_set_data()</CODE>) this mask is used. Otherwise, the call is assumed
to be from <CODE>pam_end()</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_DATA_SILENT</CODE></B><DD><P>Which indicates that the process would prefer to perform the
<CODE>cleanup()</CODE> quietly. That is, discourages logging/messages to the
user.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This function together with the previous one provides a method of
associating module-specific data with the handle <CODE>pamh</CODE>. A
successful call to <CODE>pam_get_data</CODE> will result in <CODE>*data</CODE>
pointing to the data associated with the <CODE>module_data_name</CODE>. Note,
this data is <EM>not</EM> a copy and should be treated as <EM>constant</EM>
by the module.
<P>
<P>Note, if there is an entry but it has the value <CODE>NULL</CODE>, then this
call returns <CODE>PAM_NO_MODULE_DATA</CODE>.

<P>
<P>This function is used to (re)set the value of one of the
<CODE>item_type</CODE>s.  The reader is urged to read the entry for this
function in the <B>Linux-PAM</B> application developers' manual.
<P>
<P>In addition to the <CODE>item</CODE>s listed there, the module can set the
following two <CODE>item_type</CODE>s:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK</CODE></B><DD><P>The authentication token (often a password). This token should be
ignored by all module functions besides <CODE>pam_sm_authenticate()</CODE> and
<CODE>pam_sm_chauthtok()</CODE>. In the former function it is used to pass the
most recent authentication token from one stacked module to
another. In the latter function the token is used for another
purpose. It contains the currently active authentication token.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_OLDAUTHTOK</CODE></B><DD><P>The old authentication token. This token should be ignored by all
module functions except <CODE>pam_sm_chauthtok()</CODE>.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<P>Both of these items are reset before returning to the application.
When resetting these items, the <B>Linux-PAM</B> library first writes
<CODE>0</CODE>'s to the current tokens and then <CODE>free()</CODE>'s the associated
memory.
<P>
<P>The return values for this function are listed in the 
<B>Linux-PAM</B> Application Developers' Guide.

<H3>Getting items</H3>

<P>Synopsis:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
extern int pam_get_item(const pam_handle_t *pamh,
                        int item_type,
                        const void **item);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This function is used to obtain the value of the specified
<CODE>item_type</CODE>. It is better documented in the <B>Linux-PAM</B>
Application Developers' Guide. However, there are three things worth
stressing here:
<UL>
<LI>Generally, if the module wishes to obtain the name of the user, it
should not use this function, but instead perform a call to
<CODE>pam_get_user()</CODE> (see section 
<A HREF="#pam-get-user">below</A>).
</LI>
<LI>The module is additionally privileged to read the authentication
tokens, <CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK</CODE> and <CODE>PAM_OLDAUTHTOK</CODE> (see the section
above on <CODE>pam_set_data()</CODE>).
</LI>
<LI>The module should <EM>not</EM> <CODE>free()</CODE> or alter the data pointed to by
<CODE>*item</CODE> after a successful return from <CODE>pam_get_item()</CODE>. This
pointer points directly at the data contained within the <CODE>*pamh</CODE>
structure.  Should a module require that a change is made to the this
<CODE>ITEM</CODE> it should make the appropriate call to <CODE>pam_set_item()</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>The <EM>conversation</EM> mechanism</H3>

<P>Following the call <CODE>pam_get_item(pamh,PAM_CONV,&amp;item)</CODE>, the
pointer <CODE>item</CODE> points to a structure containing an a pointer to a
<EM>conversation</EM>-function that provides limited but direct access to
the application.  The purpose of this function is to allow the module
to prompt the user for their password and pass other information in a
manner consistent with the application. For example, an X-windows
based program might pop up a dialog box to report a login
failure. Just as the application should not be concerned with the
method of authentication, so the module should not dictate the manner
in which input (output) is obtained from (presented to) to the user.
<P>
<P><B>The reader is strongly urged to read the more complete description of
the <CODE>pam_conv</CODE> structure, written from the perspective of the
application developer, in the <B>Linux-PAM</B> Application Developers'
Guide.</B>
<P>
<P>The return values for this function are listed in the 
<B>Linux-PAM</B> Application Developers' Guide.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>pam_response</CODE> structure returned after a call to the
<CODE>pam_conv</CODE> function must be <CODE>free()</CODE>'d by the module. Since the
call to the conversation function originates from the module, it is
clear that this <CODE>pam_response</CODE> structure could be either statically
or dynamically (using <CODE>malloc()</CODE> etc.) allocated within the
application. Repeated calls to the conversation function would likely
overwrite static memory, so it is required that for a successful
return from the conversation function the memory for the response
structure is dynamically allocated by the application with one of the
<CODE>malloc()</CODE> family of commands and <EM>must</EM> be <CODE>free()</CODE>'d by the
module.
<P>
<P>If the <CODE>pam_conv</CODE> mechanism is used to enter authentication tokens,
the module should either pass the result to the <CODE>pam_set_item()</CODE>
library function, or copy it itself. In such a case, once the token
has been stored (by one of these methods or another one), the memory
returned by the application should be overwritten with <CODE>0</CODE>'s, and
then <CODE>free()</CODE>'d.
<P>There is a handy macro <CODE>_pam_drop_reply()</CODE> to be found in
<CODE>&lt;security/_pam_macros.h&gt;</CODE> that can be used to
conveniently cleanup a <CODE>pam_response</CODE> structure. (Note, this
include file is specific to the Linux-PAM sources, and whilst it will
work with Sun derived PAM implementations, it is not generally
distributed by Sun.)

<P>
<P>This is a <B>Linux-PAM</B> library function that returns the
(prospective) name of the user. To determine the username it does the
following things, in this order:
<UL>
<LI> checks what <CODE>pam_get_item(pamh, PAM_USER, ... );</CODE> would have
returned. If this is not <CODE>NULL</CODE> this is what it returns. Otherwise,
</LI>
<LI> obtains a username from the application via the <CODE>pam_conv</CODE>

</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>By whatever means the username is obtained, a pointer to it is
returned as the contents of <CODE>*user</CODE>. Note, this memory should
<EM>not</EM> be <CODE>free()</CODE>'d by the module. Instead, it will be liberated
on the next call to <CODE>pam_get_user()</CODE>, or by <CODE>pam_end()</CODE> when the
application ends its interaction with <B>Linux-PAM</B>.
<P>
<P>Also, in addition, it should be noted that this function sets the
<CODE>PAM_USER</CODE> item that is associated with the <CODE>pam_[gs]et_item()</CODE>
function.

<P>The return value of this function is one of the following:
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> - username obtained.
</LI>
<LI> <CODE>PAM_CONV_AGAIN</CODE> - converstation did not complete and the
caller is required to return control to the application, until such
time as the application has completed the conversation process. A
module calling <CODE>pam_get_user()</CODE> that obtains this return code,
should return <CODE>PAM_INCOMPLETE</CODE> and be prepared (when invoked the
next time) to recall <CODE>pam_get_user()</CODE> to fill in the user's name,
and then pick up where it left off as if nothing had happened. This
procedure is needed to support an event-driven application programming
model.
</LI>

<P>
<P><B>Linux-PAM</B> comes equipped with a series of functions for

<P>The default environment is all but empty. It contains a single

<PRE>
#ifdef PAM_FAIL_DELAY

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Generally, an application requests that a user is authenticated by
<B>Linux-PAM</B> through a call to <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> or
<CODE>pam_chauthtok()</CODE>.  These functions call each of the <EM>stacked</EM>
authentication modules listed in the <B>Linux-PAM</B> configuration
file.  As directed by this file, one of more of the modules may fail
causing the <CODE>pam_...()</CODE> call to return an error.  It is desirable
for there to also be a pause before the application continues. The
principal reason for such a delay is security: a delay acts to
discourage <EM>brute force</EM> dictionary attacks primarily, but also
helps hinder <EM>timed</EM> (cf. covert channel) attacks.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>pam_fail_delay()</CODE> function provides the mechanism by which an
application or module can suggest a minimum delay (of <CODE>micro_sec</CODE>
<EM>micro-seconds</EM>). <B>Linux-PAM</B> keeps a record of the longest time
requested with this function. Should <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> fail,
the failing return to the application is delayed by an amount of time
randomly distributed (by up to 25%) about this longest value.
<P>
<P>Independent of success, the delay time is reset to its zero default
value when <B>Linux-PAM</B> returns control to the application.
