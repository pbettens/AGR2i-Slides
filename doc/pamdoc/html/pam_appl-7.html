<P>The following are a list of terms used within this document.

<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Authentication token</B><DD><P>Generally, this is a password.  However, a user can authenticate
him/herself in a variety of ways.  Updating the user's authentication
token thus corresponds to <EM>refreshing</EM> the object they use to
authenticate themself with the system.  The word password is avoided
to keep open the possibility that the authentication involves a
retinal scan or other non-textual mode of challenge/response.
<P>
<DT><B>Credentials</B><DD><P>Having successfully authenticated the user, PAM is able to establish
certain characteristics/attributes of the user.  These are termed
<EM>credentials</EM>.  Examples of which are group memberships to
perform privileged tasks with, and <EM>tickets</EM> in the form of
environment variables etc. .  Some user-credentials, such as the
user's UID and GID (plus default group memberships) are not deemed to
be PAM-credentials.  It is the responsibility of the application to
grant these directly.
