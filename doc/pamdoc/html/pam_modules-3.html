<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What is expected of a module</A></H2>

<P>The module must supply a sub-set of the six functions listed
below. Together they define the function of a <B>Linux-PAM
module</B>. Module developers are strongly urged to read the comments on
security that follow this list.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>The six module functions are grouped into four independent management
groups. These groups are as follows: <EM>authentication</EM>,
<EM>account</EM>, <EM>session</EM> and <EM>password</EM>. To be properly defined,
a module must define all functions within at least one of these
groups. A single module may contain the necessary functions for
<EM>all</EM> four groups.
<P>
<H3>Functional independence</H3>

<P>The independence of the four groups of service a module can offer
means that the module should allow for the possibility that any one of
these four services may legitimately be called in any order. Thus, the
module writer should consider the appropriateness of performing a
service without the prior success of some other part of the module.
<P>
<P>As an informative example, consider the possibility that an
application applies to change a user's authentication token, without
having first requested that <B>Linux-PAM</B> authenticate the user. In
some cases this may be deemed appropriate: when <CODE>root</CODE> wants to
change the authentication token of some lesser user. In other cases it
may not be appropriate: when <CODE>joe</CODE> maliciously wants to reset
<CODE>alice</CODE>'s password; or when anyone other than the user themself
wishes to reset their <EM>KERBEROS</EM> authentication token. A policy for
this action should be defined by any reasonable authentication scheme,
the module writer should consider this when implementing a given
module.
<P>
<H3>Minimizing administration problems</H3>

<P>To avoid system administration problems and the poor construction of a
<CODE>/etc/pam.conf</CODE> file, the module developer may define all
six of the following functions. For those functions that would not be
called, the module should return <CODE>PAM_SERVICE_ERR</CODE> and write an
appropriate message to the system log. When this action is deemed
inappropriate, the function would simply return <CODE>PAM_IGNORE</CODE>.
<P>
<H3>Arguments supplied to the module</H3>

<P>The <CODE>flags</CODE> argument of each of the following functions can be
logically OR'd with <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>, which is used to inform the
module to not pass any <EM>text</EM> (errors or warnings) to the
application.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>argc</CODE> and <CODE>argv</CODE> arguments are taken from the line
appropriate to this module---that is, with the <EM>service_name</EM>
matching that of the application---in the configuration file (see the
<B>Linux-PAM</B> System Administrators' Guide). Together these two
parameters provide the number of arguments and an array of pointers to
the individual argument tokens. This will be familiar to C programmers
as the ubiquitous method of passing command arguments to the function
<CODE>main()</CODE>. Note, however, that the first argument (<CODE>argv[0]</CODE>) is
a true argument and <B>not</B> the name of the module.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Authentication management</A>
</H2>

<P>To be correctly initialized, <CODE>PAM_SM_AUTH</CODE> must be <CODE>#define</CODE>'d
prior to including <CODE>&lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</CODE>. This will
ensure that the prototypes for static modules are properly declared.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_authenticate(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags,
int argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function performs the task of authenticating the user. 
<P>
<P>The <CODE>flags</CODE> argument can be a logically OR'd with <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>
and optionally take the following value:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK</CODE></B><DD><P>return <CODE>PAM_AUTH_ERR</CODE> if the database of authentication
tokens for this authentication mechanism has a <CODE>NULL</CODE> entry for the
user. Without this flag, such a <CODE>NULL</CODE> token will lead to a success
without the user being prompted.
</DL>
<P>
<P>Besides <CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> return values that can be sent by this
function are one of the following:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTH_ERR</CODE></B><DD><P>The user was not authenticated
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT</CODE></B><DD><P>For some reason the application does not have sufficient
credentials to authenticate the user.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL</CODE></B><DD><P>The modules were not able to access the authentication
information. This might be due to a network or hardware failure etc.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN</CODE></B><DD><P>The supplied username is not known to the authentication
service
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_MAXTRIES</CODE></B><DD><P>One or more of the authentication modules has reached its
limit of tries authenticating the user. Do not try again.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_setcred(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int
argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function performs the task of altering the credentials of the
user with respect to the corresponding authorization
scheme. Generally, an authentication module may have access to more
information about a user than their authentication token. This
function is used to make such information available to the
application. It should only be called <EM>after</EM> the user has been
authenticated but before a session has been established.
<P>
<P>Permitted flags, one of which, may be logically OR'd with
<CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE> are,
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED</CODE></B><DD><P>Set the credentials for the authentication service,
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_DELETE_CRED</CODE></B><DD><P>Delete the credentials associated with the authentication service,
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED</CODE></B><DD><P>Reinitialize the user credentials, and
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_REFRESH_CRED</CODE></B><DD><P>Extend the lifetime of the user credentials.
</DL>
<P>
<P>Prior to <B>Linux-PAM-0.75</B>, and due to a deficiency with the way the
<CODE>auth</CODE> stack was handled in the case of the setcred stack being
processed, the module was required to attempt to return the same error
code as <CODE>pam_sm_authenticate</CODE> did.  This was necessary to preserve
the logic followed by libpam as it executes the stack of
<EM>authentication</EM> modules, when the application called either
<CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> or <CODE>pam_setcred()</CODE>.  Failing to do this,
led to confusion on the part of the System Administrator.
<P>
<P>For <B>Linux-PAM-0.75</B> and later, libpam handles the credential stack
much more sanely. The way the <CODE>auth</CODE> stack is navigated in order to
evaluate the <CODE>pam_setcred()</CODE> function call, independent of the
<CODE>pam_sm_setcred()</CODE> return codes, is exactly the same way that it
was navigated when evaluating the <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE> library
call. Typically, if a stack entry was ignored in evaluating
<CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE>, it will be ignored when libpam evaluates the
<CODE>pam_setcred()</CODE> function call. Otherwise, the return codes from
each module specific <CODE>pam_sm_setcred()</CODE> call are treated as
<CODE>required</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Besides <CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE>, the module may return one of the following
errors:
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL</CODE></B><DD><P>This module cannot retrieve the user's credentials.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_CRED_EXPIRED</CODE></B><DD><P>The user's credentials have expired.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN</CODE></B><DD><P>The user is not known to this authentication module.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_CRED_ERR</CODE></B><DD><P>This module was unable to set the credentials of the user.
</DL>
<P>
<P>these, non-<CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE>, return values will typically lead to the
credential stack <EM>failing</EM>. The first such error will dominate in
the return value of <CODE>pam_setcred()</CODE>.
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Account management</A>
</H2>

<P>To be correctly initialized, <CODE>PAM_SM_ACCOUNT</CODE> must be
<CODE>#define</CODE>'d prior to including <CODE>&lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</CODE>.
This will ensure that the prototype for a static module is properly
declared.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_acct_mgmt(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int
argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function performs the task of establishing whether the user is
permitted to gain access at this time. It should be understood that
the user has previously been validated by an authentication
module. This function checks for other things. Such things might be:
the time of day or the date, the terminal line, remote
hostname, etc. .
<P>
<P>This function may also determine things like the expiration on
passwords, and respond that the user change it before continuing.
<P>
<P>Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>, are the
same as those applicable to the <CODE>flags</CODE> argument of
<CODE>pam_sm_authenticate</CODE>.
<P>
<P>This function may return one of the following errors,
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_ACCT_EXPIRED</CODE></B><DD><P>The user is no longer permitted access to the system.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTH_ERR</CODE></B><DD><P>There was an authentication error.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD</CODE></B><DD><P>The user's authentication token has expired. Before calling
this function again the application will arrange for a new one to be
given. This will likely result in a call to <CODE>pam_sm_chauthtok()</CODE>.
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN</CODE></B><DD><P>The user is not known to the module's account management
component.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Session management</A>
</H2>

<P>To be correctly initialized, <CODE>PAM_SM_SESSION</CODE> must be
<CODE>#define</CODE>'d prior to including
<CODE>&lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</CODE>.  This will ensure that the
prototypes for static modules are properly declared.
<P>
<P>The following two functions are defined to handle the
initialization/termination of a session. For example, at the beginning
of a session the module may wish to log a message with the system
regarding the user. Similarly, at the end of the session the module
would inform the system that the user's session has ended.
<P>
<P>It should be possible for sessions to be opened by one application and
closed by another. This either requires that the module uses only
information obtained from <CODE>pam_get_item()</CODE>, or that information
regarding the session is stored in some way by the operating system
(in a file for example).
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_open_session(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int
argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function is called to commence a session. The only valid, but
optional, flag is <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>.
<P>
<P>As a return value, <CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> signals success and
<CODE>PAM_SESSION_ERR</CODE> failure.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_close_session(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int
argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function is called to terminate a session. The only valid, but
optional, flag is <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>.
<P>
<P>As a return value, <CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> signals success and
<CODE>PAM_SESSION_ERR</CODE> failure.
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Password management</A>
</H2>

<P>To be correctly initialized, <CODE>PAM_SM_PASSWORD</CODE> must be
<CODE>#define</CODE>'d prior to including <CODE>&lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</CODE>.
This will ensure that the prototype for a static module is properly
declared.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>PAM_EXTERN int pam_sm_chauthtok(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int
argc, const char **argv);</CODE>

<P>This function is used to (re-)set the authentication token of the
user. A valid flag, which may be logically OR'd with <CODE>PAM_SILENT</CODE>,
can be built from the following list,
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK</CODE></B><DD><P>This argument indicates to the module that the users
authentication token (password) should only be changed if it has
expired. This flag is optional and <EM>must</EM> be combined with one of
the following two flags. Note, however, the following two options are
<EM>mutually exclusive</EM>.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_PRELIM_CHECK</CODE></B><DD><P>This indicates that the modules are being probed as to their
ready status for altering the user's authentication token. If the
module requires access to another system over some network it should
attempt to verify it can connect to this system on receiving this
flag. If a module cannot establish it is ready to update the user's
authentication token it should return <CODE>PAM_TRY_AGAIN</CODE>, this
information will be passed back to the application.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK</CODE></B><DD><P>This informs the module that this is the call it should change
the authorization tokens. If the flag is logically OR'd with
<CODE>PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK</CODE>, the token is only changed if it has
actually expired.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<P>Note, the <B>Linux-PAM</B> library calls this function twice in
succession. The first time with <CODE>PAM_PRELIM_CHECK</CODE> and then, if the
module does not return <CODE>PAM_TRY_AGAIN</CODE>, subsequently with
<CODE>PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK</CODE>. It is only on the second call that the
authorization token is (possibly) changed.
<P>
<P><CODE>PAM_SUCCESS</CODE> is the only successful return value, valid
error-returns are:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR</CODE></B><DD><P>The module was unable to obtain the new authentication token.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR</CODE></B><DD><P>The module was unable to obtain the old authentication token.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY</CODE></B><DD><P>Cannot change the authentication token since it is currently
locked.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING</CODE></B><DD><P>Authentication token aging has been disabled.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_PERM_DENIED</CODE></B><DD><P>Permission denied.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_TRY_AGAIN</CODE></B><DD><P>Preliminary check was unsuccessful. Signals an immediate return
to the application is desired.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>PAM_USER_UNKNOWN</CODE></B><DD><P>The user is not known to the authentication token changing
service.
