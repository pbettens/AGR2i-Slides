<P>Most service-giving applications are restricted.  In other words,
their service is not available to all and every prospective client.
Instead, the applying client must jump through a number of hoops to
convince the serving application that they are authorized to obtain
service.
<P>The process of <EM>authenticating</EM> a client is what PAM is designed to
manage.  In addition to authentication, PAM provides account
management, credential management, session management and
authentication-token (password changing) management services.  It is
important to realize when writing a PAM based application that these
services are provided in a manner that is <B>transparent</B> to
the application.  That is to say, when the application is written, no
assumptions can be made about <EM>how</EM> the client will be
authenticated.
<P>
<P>The process of authentication is performed by the PAM library via a
call to <CODE>pam_authenticate()</CODE>.  The return value of this
function will indicate whether a named client (the <EM>user</EM>) has
been authenticated.  If the PAM library needs to prompt the user for
any information, such as their <EM>name</EM> or a <EM>password</EM>
then it will do so.  If the PAM library is configured to authenticate
the user using some silent protocol, it will do this too.  (This
latter case might be via some hardware interface for example.)
<P>
<P>It is important to note that the application must leave all decisions
about when to prompt the user at the discretion of the PAM library.
<P>
<P>The PAM library, however, must work equally well for different styles
of application.  Some applications, like the familiar <CODE>login</CODE>
and <CODE>passwd</CODE> are terminal based applications, exchanges of
information with the client in these cases is as plain text messages.
Graphically based applications, however, have a more sophisticated
interface.  They generally interact with the user via specially
constructed dialogue boxes.  Additionally, network based services
require that text messages exchanged with the client are specially
formatted for automated processing: one such example is <CODE>ftpd</CODE>
which prefixes each exchanged message with a numeric identifier.
<P>
<P>The presentation of simple requests to a client is thus something very
dependent on the protocol that the serving application will use.  In
spite of the fact that PAM demands that it drives the whole
authentication process, it is not possible to leave such protocol
subtleties up to the PAM library.  To overcome this potential problem,
the application provides the PAM library with a <EM>conversation</EM>
function.  This function is called from <B>within</B> the PAM
library and enables the PAM to directly interact with the client.  The
sorts of things that this conversation function must be able to do are
prompt the user with text and/or obtain textual input from the user
for processing by the PAM library.  The details of this function are
provided in a later section.
<P>
<P>For example, the conversation function may be called by the PAM library
with a request to prompt the user for a password.  Its job is to
reformat the prompt request into a form that the client will
understand.  In the case of <CODE>ftpd</CODE>, this might involve prefixing
the string with the number <CODE>331</CODE> and sending the request over
the network to a connected client.  The conversation function will
then obtain any reply and, after extracting the typed password, will
return this string of text to the PAM library.  Similar concerns need
to be addressed in the case of an X-based graphical server.
<P>
<P>There are a number of issues that need to be addressed when one is
porting an existing application to become PAM compliant.  A section
below has been devoted to this: Porting legacy applications.
<P>
<P>Besides authentication, PAM provides other forms of management.
Session management is provided with calls to
<CODE>pam_open_session()</CODE> and <CODE>pam_close_session()</CODE>.  What
these functions actually do is up to the local administrator.  But
typically, they could be used to log entry and exit from the system or
for mounting and unmounting the user's home directory.  If an
application provides continuous service for a period of time, it
should probably call these functions, first open after the user is
authenticated and then close when the service is terminated.
<P>
<P>Account management is another area that an application developer
should include with a call to <CODE>pam_acct_mgmt()</CODE>.  This call will
perform checks on the good health of the user's account (has it
expired etc.). One of the things this function may check is whether
the user's authentication token has expired - in such a case the
application may choose to attempt to update it with a call to
<CODE>pam_chauthtok()</CODE>, although some applications are not suited to
this task (<EM>ftp</EM> for example) and in this case the application
should deny access to the user.
<P>
<P>PAM is also capable of setting and deleting the users credentials with
the call <CODE>pam_setcred()</CODE>.  This function should always be
called after the user is authenticated and before service is offered
to the user.  By convention, this should be the last call to the PAM
library before the PAM session is opened.  What exactly a credential
is, is not well defined.  However, some examples are given in the
glossary below.
